# ðŸ’¤ Trial and Errror: LazyVim

Built from a starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

Looking to build your own LazyVim configuration?
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

This repository is hosting the nvim configuration as a nix flake for easy portability. Inspired by JordanIsaacs and all of the other configuration variants out there, I wanted to use a nvim configuration that I built and that I can understand how it's done.
